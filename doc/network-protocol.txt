I'm just writing this up to remind myself how it works as I look to
extend the protocol to allow metric push quiescing and multiple
metric groups with different push intervals.

Server
------

In the server the main select() loop processes things in the following
order:

   - PCP Main loop
   - New client connections
   - Existing client connection


After the client connects it initiates communication with the server
periodically.  The first thing it sends is the command:

    CLUSTER_PDU_VERSION   - client sending version
    CLUSTER_PDU_ID        - client sends:  hostnamelen hostname[]
                            then waits for server to reply with
                            the CLUSTER_PDU_CONFIG
    CLUSTER_PDU_CONFIG    - Server sends the list of metrics to the
                            client:  
                                poll_interval, metric_count, pmid [,pmid ...]
    CLUSTER_PDU_INSTANCE  - Client sends:  indom, instance, name[]
    CLUSTER_PDU_RESULT    - client sends:  encoded pmResult
                            Then server sends CONFIG or SUSPEND,
                            if required.


Client
------

The main loop of the client handles reconnects, etc.
When it connects to the server the state machine starts, and
the sequence is:

    - Send version via the CLUSTER_PDU_VERSION command

    - Send hostname via the CLUSTER_PDU_ID command

    - Then it waits for the config (metric list) to be sent
      from the server.

    - Then it sends instance domains for each metric

    - Then the main fetch/send loop is entered:

        * pmFetch() is called on the list of metrics

        * CLUSTER_PDU_RESULT is sent along with the pmResult

        * Sleep for push_interval (2 seconds)
          * If the timeout expires without any suspend message
            coming from the leader, then restart the fetch/send
            loop.

        * Otherwise look for a SUSPEND message.
          If you get one then you block forever, waiting for the
          resume message to be sent.
